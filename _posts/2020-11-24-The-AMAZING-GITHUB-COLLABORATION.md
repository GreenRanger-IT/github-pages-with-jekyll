**COLLABORATION**\
Hi, welcome to my blog and today i would like to talk about **_collaboration_** in GIThub.\
GITHUB has made working with others on a project exciting and riduculously easy.\
with features like automatic pull request(already made changes waiting to be reviewed \
by team members and hence merged to your master branch) update you can continue to make \
changes(commits)and the changes get added to the pull request automatically.
